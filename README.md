# ContextWire

> Probably a huge mistake.  
> But like, a powerful, scripted, glorious mistake.

ContextWire is your new hardware automation overlord.  
It ~~talks~~ probably will talk to **Saleae**, **BusPirate**, **Silicon Labs Commander**, and even your dusty **LXI o-scope**, all from one place.  
No more 17 terminals and ritual sacrifices — just run it and shoot yourself in the leg.

## 🧠 What It Do

- 💬 Unified access to your lab gear via JSON-over-socket or CLI (TBD)
- 🔌 Supports logic analyzers, UART hackers, flash tools, scopes, whatever you throw at it
- 🧪 Perfect for embedded devs who are sick of juggling tools
- 🔧 Built with Python because I hate myself just enough

## ⚠️ Current Status

- 🚧 Alpha AF
- 😬 ~~Probably~~ doesn’t work
- 🧙‍♂️ If it does work, it’s a miracle

## 📦 Planned Device Support
